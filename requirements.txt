# Streamlit in Snowflake Requirements - Simplified
# Built-in implementations eliminate most external dependencies

# Core Streamlit (pre-installed in Snowflake)
streamlit

# Note: The following are handled conditionally in the application:
# - pandas (fallback implemented)
# - numpy (fallback implemented)  
# - snowflake-snowpark-python (pre-installed in Snowflake)
# - snowflake-connector-python (pre-installed in Snowflake)

# Charts: Uses Streamlit's native charting functions (st.line_chart, st.area_chart)

# All evaluation metrics are implemented natively in streamlit_app.py
# No external ML libraries required - works in any Python version!
